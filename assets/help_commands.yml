### SET ###
set:
  name: set
  desc: >-
    Set or change your username color. You can provide a primary color and an optional
    secondary color to create a gradient. Colors can be given as a HEX value (with or without
    a leading '#'), as a CSS color name, or by copying another user's color (mention the user,
    e.g. @kaaroll99). Use the keyword "random" to pick a random color.

    The command generates a preview image and asks for confirmation before applying the color.

    ### Parameters:
      <color> - Primary color to set (required).
      [secondary_color] - Secondary color for gradient (optional).
    ### Accepted color formats:
      - Hex: F5DF4D or #F5DF4D
      - CSS color names: royalblue
      - Other formats supported by the parser (e.g., rgb(...), hsl(...))
    ### Username:
      - Copy color from another user by mentioning them (e.g. @kaaroll99). If the selected user
        does not have a colored role an error will be returned.
    ### Notes:
      - If you don't already have a bot-managed color role, the bot will create one named
        "color-<YOUR_ID>" and assign it to you.
      - The command is subject to a cooldown.
  usage: /set <color> [secondary_color]
  example: |
    - /set f5df4d
    - /set #f5df4d 00ff00
    - /set royalblue
    - /set @kaaroll99
    - /set random
  docs: set

### REMOVE ###
remove:
  name: remove
  desc: >-
    Remove your username color. The bot will remove/unassign the bot-managed color
    role from your account. This command only affects roles created and managed by the bot.

  usage: /remove
  example: /remove
  docs: remove

### HISTORY ###
history:
  name: history
  desc: >-
    View your color change history on the server. You can see your last 5 colors and
    easily re-apply one of them using the dropdown menu.

  usage: /history
  example: /history
  docs: history

### SELECT ###
select:
  name: select
  desc: >-
    Choose one of the static colors configured on your server using a dropdown menu.
    The command generates a preview image showing your username rendered with each
    available color so you can see how it will look before applying it.

    ### Notes:
      - The server must have colors configured (up to 10 positions) using `/setup select`.
    - The command generates a small PNG preview and sends it along with the selection UI.
    - A short cooldown applies to prevent spamming (rate-limited per user per server).

  usage: /select
  example: /select
  docs: select

### CHECK ###
check:
  name: check
  desc: >-
    Get color information and a preview image (HEX, RGB, HSL, CMYK).

    ### Accepted input formats:
      - Hex (with or without `#`): `F5DF4D` or `#F5DF4D`
    - Functional notation: `rgb(...)`, `hsl(...)`
    - CSS color names (e.g. `royalblue`)
    - Mention another user to copy their color (e.g. `@kaaroll99`)
    - `random` to pick a random color
    - `random` to pick a random color

    ### What the command returns:
      - Conversions: HEX, RGB, HSL, CMYK
      - A small PNG preview image (`color_fill.png`) showing the color
      - Up to several similar CSS color names (if available)
    ### Notes:
      - Invalid formats will trigger a helpful error message directing to the docs.
      - A short cooldown is applied per user per server to prevent spam.
  usage: /check <color>
  example: /check \#F5DF4D
  docs: check

### VOTE ###
vote:
  name: vote
  desc: >-
    Displays the URL for voting.

  usage: /vote
  example: /vote
  docs: vote

### FORCESET ###
forceset:
  name: forceset
  desc: >-
    Set or change another user's username color. This command is for administrators
    and accepts the same input formats as `/set`: HEX (with or without `#`), CSS color
    names, mention a user to copy their color (e.g. `@kaaroll99`), or `random`. You may
    also provide an optional secondary color to create a gradient.

    ### Parameters:
      <user_name> - Name of the selected user
      <color> - Primary color to set (required).
      [secondary_color] - Secondary color for gradient (optional).
    ### Notes:
      - If the target user doesn't have a bot-managed color role, the bot will create
        one named `color-<USER_ID>` and assign it to the user.
    - Requires administrator privileges to run and the bot must have permission to
      manage roles.
  usage: /force set <user_name> <color>
  example: /force set @kaaroll99 f5df4d
  docs: force-set

### FORCEREMOVE ###
forceremove:
  name: forceremove
  desc: >-
    Remove another user's username color. The bot will remove/unassign the bot-managed
    color role from the selected user and delete that role if it exists. This command
    requires administrator privileges.

    ### Parameters:
    <user_name> - Name of the selected user

  usage: /force remove <user_name>
  example: /force remove @kaaroll99
  docs: force-remove

### FORCEPURGE ###
forcepurge:
  name: forcepurge
  desc: >-
    Delete HueTweaker-created color roles from the server. The command opens a confirmation
    dialog where you can choose to remove:
      - individual user color roles
    - static roles created for `/select` (if configured)
    - all color roles
    - all color roles

    ### Notes:
      - This operation is irreversible once confirmed.
      - Requires administrator privileges.
      - The command targets roles matching the pattern `color-{USER_ID}` (e.g. `color-512674615223517205`).

  usage: /force purge
  example: /force purge
  docs: force-purge

### SETUP TOPROLE ###
toprole:
  name: setup toprole
  desc: >-
    Set the top role under which HueTweaker will create and place color roles. When a
    top role is configured, the bot will position all color roles directly below the
    selected role. Use `@everyone` to reset the top role and restore default placement.


    ⚠️ The command can only be executed by a user with administrator privileges.

    ### ⚠️ Important:
      - If no top role is set, color roles will be created at the bottom of the role list,
        which may cause their color to be hidden by higher roles.
      - The chosen top role must not be higher than the bot's highest role; the bot cannot
        move color roles above its own top role. Choose a role that the bot can manage.

    ### What happens when you set a top role:
      - The bot updates stored configuration for the server and will move existing roles
        whose names match the pattern `color-<USER_ID>` to sit under the selected top role.
      - Setting `@everyone` clears the saved top role from the server configuration.

    ### 💡 Roles example:
      - [Admin]
      - [Bot]  <- bot higher role
      - [colors]  <- chosen top role
      - [color-...]

    `<role_name>` - Name of the selected role

  usage: /setup toprole <role_name>
  example: /setup toprole @colors
  docs: setup-toprole

### SETUP SELECT ###

setupselect:
  name: setup select
  desc: >-
    Configure the static color list for the `/select` command. This opens an interactive
    panel where administrators can create the color list or add/edit entries.

    ### Behavior highlights:
      - The list supports up to 10 positions (stored as `hex_1` .. `hex_10` in the DB).
      - If no colors exist yet you'll see a **Create color list** button; otherwise an **Add/Edit color on list** button is shown.
      - Editing opens a modal with two fields:
          * Color index (1-10) — position in the `/select` menu (validated)
        * Color value — hex (e.g. `F5DF4D` or `#F5DF4D`) or CSS color name (e.g. `royalblue`)
      - Leaving the color value empty clears that entry.
    ### Notes & validation:
      - Index must be an integer between 1 and 10; invalid input will show a warning
        and keep the current list unchanged.
      - Colors are parsed with the same rules as `/set` (hex or CSS names).
      - Only users with administrator privileges can run this command.

  usage: /setup select
  example: /setup select
  docs: setup-select
